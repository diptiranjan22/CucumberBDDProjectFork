Feature: Login to the omayo application 

Scenario Outline: User should only be able to login with valid credentials
Given I navigate to the omayo website
When I enter Username as "<username>" and Password as "<password>" into the fields
And I click on Login button 
Then User should login based on expected "<loginstatus>" status
Examples:
|username				|password		|loginstatus	|
|arun    				|pswd1    	|failure   		|
|SeleniumByArun	|Test143$		|success			|
|motoori				|pswd2			|failure 			|
